Cow Detection in Soaker Area

Abstract:

Diamond J. Dairy is a modern dairy farm that utilizes an automated, state-of-the-art soaker system to keep their cows cool and maximize dairy production. Currently, there is significant water waste because the soaker system turns on when cows are not present in the soaking area. For environmental and economic reasons, water conservation is a high priority for Diamond J. Dairy. The Cool Cow Coders have developed a vision-based program that recognizes and detects cows within the soaking area. When deployed throughout the farm, the teamâ€™s software will aid water conservation efforts by ensuring soaker valves are only activated when a cow is within its soaking vicinity.
